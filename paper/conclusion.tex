In this paper, we studied the encounter registration problem in a single-hop network.
We proposed a protocol consisting of two stages, namely detecting stage and 
connecting stage. Our protocol guaranteed that, when an encounter happens, 
an agent in detecting stage would switch 
to connecting stage very soon. 
We carried out extensive simulations and experiments, and 
evaluation results showed that our protocol achieved 
better scalability and were more applicable to mobile
wildlife environment. 
% Our protocol has potential to be applicable
% to various wireless mobile networks.

% After all the agents are in the connecting stage,  
% each of them can record all the peers in $O(k)$ slots with high probability.
% We present concrete analysis of the protocol under the radio model and validate the model 
% by real-world experiments.
