In this paper, we studied the encounter registration problem in a single-hop network of $k$ 
agents. We proposed a protocol consisting of two stages, namely detecting stage and 
connecting stage. Our protocol guaranteed that, when an encounter happens, 
an agent in detecting stage would switch 
to the connecting stage very soon. After all the agents are in the connecting stage,  
each of them can record all the peers in $O(k)$ slots with high probability.
We present concrete analysis of the protocol under the radio model and validate the model 
by real-world experiments.
