\section{Conclusions}
\label{sectionconclusion}

In this paper, we study the encounter registration problem in a single-hop network of $k$ 
agents. We propose a protocol consisting of two stages, namely detecting stage and 
connecting stage. Our protocol guarantee that, when an encounter happens, 
an agent in detecting stage will switch 
to the connecting stage soon. After all the agents are in the connecting stage,  
each of them can record all the peers in $O(k)$ slots with high probability.
We present concrete analysis of the protocol under the radio model and validate the model 
by real-world experiments.
