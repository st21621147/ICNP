\section{System Model}
\label{sectionmodel}

In this paper, we study the encounter problem in a wildlife 
tracing system. 
We call individual animals as \emph{agents}, 
and \emph{peers} are referred as other agents that distinguish from 
a specific one.
The definition of the \emph{Encounter process} is formulated as follows.
\begin{definition}
Encounter is defined as the process that 
an agent detects and records message
from other peer(s) if they keep at least $T_0$ slots of 
close proximity $\Delta \leq D$
in the wildlife tracking system. 
\end{definition}

In the following, we describe the system model for theoretical analysis in this paper.



\subsection{Communication Model}

% First, we present the communication model in this paper.

In the  wildlife tracing system {\sysname}, the encounter process 
is a common biological behavior and
happens when more than one agents gather closely, constituting a 
single clique of size $k$~($k \geq 2$).
Note that, $k$ is not known to each agent and the whole 
clique composes a sing-hop network for communication due to the proximity. 

Each agent is equipped with a tag containing radio. 
An agent that has its radio on can choose to be in the $Transmit$ state
or the $Listen$ state:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Transmit state:} an agent transmits (broadcasts) 
a message containing its ID on the channel;
\item  \textbf{Listen state:} an agent listens on 
the channel to receive messages from peers.
\end{itemize}

Suppose time is divided into slots of equal length $t_0$
, which is assumed to be sufficient to finish a complete
communication process (one agent transmits a message including its ID and
a peer receives the message).

An agent transmit successfully in a time slot if and only if 
it is the only one transmitting and all the other peer(s) will
receive its message and record its ID. Otherwise the channel is detected
as \emph{idle} if there is no transmission and \emph{busy} if there 
are simultaneous messages.

In the wildlife tracing system {\sysname}, 
on the one hand,
each agent (animal) is equipped with an energy-restricted tag;
on the other hand, encounter process happens occasionally, and
it is a waste of energy if transmitting while there is no encounter with other peer(s). 
Thus in order to keep a balance between the energy consumption 
and the efficiency of encounter process, we introduce the duty cycle mechanism.

\textbf{Duty cycle mechanism.} 
An agent has the capability to turn off the radio to save
energy for most of the time, and may only be active 
(transmitting or receiving) during a fraction $\theta$ of the time.
%, where $\theta$ is typically $1/100$ or less.

Incorporating the duty cycle mechanism, in each time slot an agent $u_i$ is able to adopt an action as:
$$ s_i^t=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&Sleep  & & & &{sleep~ with~ probability~ (1-\theta_i)}  	 \\
&Transmit  & & & &{transmit~ with~ probability~ \theta_i p}	\\
&Listen  & & & &{listen~ with~ probability~\theta_i(1-p)}	\\
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
\emph{Duty cycle} is defined as the fraction of time an agent turns its radio on, 
which is formulated as:
$$\theta_i=\frac{|\{t: 0\leq t<t_0, s_i(t) \in \{Transimit,Listen\}\}|}{t_0}.
$$

% \subsection{Interference Model}

% In reality, wireless transmission suffers from interference.
% We consider graph model as the interference model in our protocol. 
% Graph model is a popular one that enables the development of
% efficient algorithms for crucial networking problems. Some other models,
% such as the signal to interference plus noise ratio (\emph{SINR}) model,
% are more complicated and lack good algorithmic features. 
% In addition, it is shown that SINR can be transformed to the graph model by
% particular means.

% In the graph model, we assume that the communication range of each agent 
% is $D$ meters and an agent $u_i$ can discover its nearby peer $u_j$ 
% in time slot $t$ if and only if $u_j$ is the only peer in $u_i$'s range 
% that transmits and $u_i$ is listening in the slot.




% Suppose the distance between two nodes $u_i$ and $u_j$ is $\Delta_{i,j}$.
% The connectivity of the edge $e_{i,j}$ in the graph model is formulated as:
% $$ \omega_e=\left\{
% \begin{aligned}
% &0  & & &   &D \leq \Delta_{i,j}	 \\
% %&\phi_{i,j}  & & & 	&d \leq \Delta_{i,j} \leq D\\
% &1  & & & &\Delta_{i,j} \leq D	\\
% \end{aligned}
% \right.
% $$
% %where $\varphi(\Delta)$ is an inverse function 
% %(e.g., the weight is inversely proportional to the distance).
 
% An agent $u_i$ can discover its peer $u_j$ in
% time slot $t$ if and only if $u_j$ is the only peer transmitting 
% in the range of $u_i$ ($\Delta_{i,j} \leq D$) and $u_i$ is listening in the slot.
% An agent suffers from collisions when it receives simultaneous messages. 


\textbf{Collision detection mechanism.}
A listening agent can distinguish whether the channel is \emph{idle} or \emph{busy}, 
apart from successful receiving a message. 

\subsection{Problem formulation}

We formulate the problem in this paper as follows:
\begin{problem}
    We define an encounter problem as to design a protocol to guarantee 
    all the agents in the clique can receive message from each other at least once 
    if they encounter for at least $T$ ($T \leq T_0$) time 
    slots~(i.e., $T$ is the upper bound of the protocol). 
\end{problem}


We look into the problem and find the key challenge is 
the uncertainty of dynamic movements
of agents. Despite the dynamicity in this real system, 
when $T_0$ is short enough relative to 
the time required for an agent to move a step~(a short distance)
in reality~(e.g., less than $1$ second),
we can make a reasonable assumption that the communication 
connectivity of the agents is stable during each $T_0$ time slots.
